# Prive Web, an unofficial Telegram client

Prive Web is a modified version of [Telegram WebK](https://github.com/morethanwords/tweb) (GPL-3.0), served at https://priveconnect.com/web.
It is **not affiliated with Telegram**. It adds Prive features (client / website-administrator modes, Website Connect,
website shortcuts, per-chat translation, Noir theme) on top of WebK.

- Upstream base: morethanwords/tweb (WebK), October 2026. Prive changes live mainly in `src/prive/` and `public/prive/`,
  plus small hooks in `src/components/` (settings, chat topbar, message body, web apps) and `src/lib/`.
- Android app: https://github.com/y985zcnd5z-commits/prive-android

## Building

Use **your own** Telegram API credentials from https://my.telegram.org. They are injected at build time and are not in this repo:

```
printf "VITE_API_ID=<your id>\nVITE_API_HASH=<your hash>\n" > .env.production.local
pnpm install && npx vite build                # output in dist/ (public/ holds static assets)
```

#### Running web-server
Just run `pnpm start` to start the web server and the livereload task.
Open http://localhost:8080/ in your browser.


#### Running in production

Run `node build` to build the minimized production version of the app. Copy `public` folder contents to your web server.

### Running in docker

#### Developing: 
* Install dependencies `docker-compose up tweb.dependencies`.
* Run develop container `docker-compose up tweb.develop `.
* Open http://localhost:8080/ in your browser. 

#### Production:
* Run `docker-compose up tweb.production -d` nginx image and container to serve the build
* Open http://localhost:80/ in your browser.

You can use `docker build -f ./.docker/Dockerfile_production -t {dockerhub-username}/{imageName}:{latest} .` to build your production ready image.

### Debugging
You are welcome in helping to minimize the impact of bugs. There are classes, binded to global context. Look through the code for certain one and just get it by its name in developer tools.
Source maps are included in production build for your convenience.

#### Additional query parameters
* **test=1**: to use test DCs
* **debug=1**: to enable additional logging
* **noSharedWorker=1**: to disable Shared Worker, can be useful for debugging
* **http=1**: to force the use of HTTPS transport when connecting to Telegram servers

Should be applied like that: http://localhost:8080/?test=1

#### Taking local storage snapshots
You can also take and load snapshots of the local storage and indexed DB using the `./snapshot-server` [mini-app](/snapshot-server/README.md). Check the `README.md` under this folder for more details.

#### Preview all icons
You can see all the available svg icons by calling the `showIconLibrary()` global function in the browser's console.
